Playdao is a protocol that aims to achieve world consciousness. It uses a global decentralized acyclic graph protocol of interdependent weighted actions called the **Action Graph** which is coupled with a **Value Tree** enabling each action to be weighted within different trees. Playdao is non-profit and open-source and is the substrate required for value & task driven currency-free systems & gift-economies of the future. Playdaos protocol couples fundamental concepts from graph theory, blockchain, cryptography, economy, and artificial intelligence into a single action-value-based system enabling greater transparency, efficiency, and fairness. Playdao connects education & learning, exchange of goods and services, and organizational structures into one global interconnected ecosystem.

Each action in Playdaos action graph has **dependency rules** - other discreet action prerequisites and/or values required to serve as reputation to either observe or perform the action. Actions can be things such as "giving a cookie", "reading a book", "taking a specfic class", or any other generic form of attestation.

Actions are also linked to different **Values** via **Value Trees** consisting of **Swap Nodes** which connect up to form a tree. Each node within the tree acts as a barter comparison formula between different actions (2 - infinity). Swap nodes are rules for weighing different actions against each other. Actions can respect different **Swap Nodes** within their dependency rules to act as proofs of reputation. Reputation is recycled back into the system when it used as proof upon action completion. 

The value tree acts as a comparasion algorithom for different actions and value can be thought of as reputation / trust within each interlinked action graph. The value of each action ( its max supply ) can be thought of as its weight or impact as a ratio of the entire the value tree to which the acion belongs to. Value is "recycled" back into the system after it used as proof. All actions that are part of the value tree are ratios (e.g. 1/3) of the value represented as a single whole (1) with the max supply of each action adding up to the ratio of the action. **Value Trees** are free market driven and determined by **Action Swap Nodes** - nodes that equate actions against each other, Actions can have multiple value ratios rewarded for them.

Privacy is a core feature of the protocol, playdao uses powerful cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs to separate participants' identities (action certificates) & the action graph. Each agent who participates in the action graph fully controls their data.

The protocol is built on top of a distributed & decentralized vector graph database designed to be directly plugged into a neural network for analysis and detection of patterns formed by the connections of different actions and their supply & demand. This enables complex ai-generated value trees and suggestions for action dependencies. This aims to achieve the type of value driven coupling required for A.I and human alignment.

Playdao is accessible to everyone and aims to build tools for small businesses and communities. Its grand vision is to build a new foundation for the triple coupling of A.I, economy, and organization to enable the creation of a more just, sustainable, and conscious future.

Playdao is currently in concept/research stage and extensive simulation is required to simulate this new barter/reputation-like social system of interlinked actions via AI enabled automous self-interset agents.
