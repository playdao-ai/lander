# Unlocking Global Consciousness Through Action

Playdao is a non-profit open-source substrate protocol that aims to achieve world consciousness. It uses a graph of interdependent actions and tasks to build self-governing educational, social, and economic structures, enabling greater transparency, efficiency, and fairness.


The protocol is built on top of a distributed and decentralized vector graph database that can be directly plugged into a neural network to learn from our communal behaviors, analyze complex trends on macro and micro levels, fine-tune organizations, and suggest life paths through tasks. This creates the highest coupling of A.I and human for ultimate alignment.


Privacy is a core feature of the protocol, using powerful cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs to separate participants' identities, action histories, and the action graph itself.


Playdao is accessible to everyone and aims to build tools for small businesses and communities. Its grand vision is to build a new foundation for the triple coupling of A.I, economy, and organization to enable the creation of a more just, sustainable, and conscious future.
